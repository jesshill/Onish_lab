**smFISH Protocol**

**NEEDED REAGENTS AND SOLUTIONS**

0\.44% Bleaching Solution** \*only need if embryo prepping sample and trying to image embryos.

- 40 mL sterile water
- 7.2 mL 5 N NaOH
- 4.5 mL 5% NaHOCl

Liquid Nitrogen

- Fill a Dewar with liquid N<sub>2</sub>

Wash Buffer A (10% v/v formamide)

- Make fresh for each experiment. 
- Make up 3 mL for each sample to be hybridized. Combine reagents into a nuclease free tube and vortex to mix. 
  - 200 uL x3 600 uL Wash Buffer A (Biosearch Technologies; Cat#: SMF-WA1-60) 
  - 0.7 mL x3 2.1 mL DEPC water
  - 100 uL x3 300 uL Deionized Formamide 

In fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), the addition of formamide to aqueous buffers solutions of DNA enables key procedural steps—such as the prehybridization denaturation, the reannealing step and the post-hybridization stringency washes—to be carried out at lower, less harsh temperatures without compromising the overall efficiency and specificity of the hybridization.

Wash Buffer B

- Make sure water has been added to Wash Buffer B before use (Biosearch Technologies; Cat#: SMF-WB1-20) 

Hybridization Buffer (10% v/v formamide)

- Prepare 110 uL for each sample to be hybridized
- Buffer should be mixed fresh for each experiment
- For a final volume of 110 uL, mix 99 µL of Stellaris RNA FISH Hybridization Buffer (Biosearch Technologies; Cat#: SMF-HB1-10) with 11 µL Deionized Formamide. 

*Do not freeze Hybridization Buffer.*

Pre-chill Acetone and Methanol 

- Prepare 1 mL for each sample.
- Place acetone/methanol in -20C freezer. Allow to cool. 
  1. If time runs out and acetone/methanol is not cool, freeze it quickly in liquid N<sub>2</sub>, allow to thaw, and then place in the -20C freezer.

Mounting Medium (5 mL)

- 2.5 mL of 100% glycerol
- 25 mg of N-propyl gallate\*
- 100 uL of 1M Tris (pH 8.0)
- 2.4 mL of DEPC H<sub>2</sub>0

Updated Mounting Medium (3 mL)

- 2.5 mL of 100% glycerol
- 100 mg of N-propyl gallate\*
- 400 uL of 1M Tris (pH 8.0)


*\*Add N-propyl gallate last*

- Vortex until completely dissolved.
- Minimize exposure to light (N-propyl gallate is light sensitive).
- Prepare 1 mL aliquots in dark tubes or tubes wrapped in foil.
- Store at 4°C or -20°C.
- When medium turns yellow and begins crystalizing make fresh* 


**PROTOCOL**

Harvest worms

1. Grow worms until they are gravid. 
1. Harvest worms by washing them off the plates with M9. Collect in a 15 mL conical tube.
1. Centrifuge at 2000 x g for 1 min to pellet.
1. Aspirate supernatant. Add 10 mL M9 to wash.
1. Repeat wash until supernatant is clear.
1. After the final wash: 
   1. if you are planning to embryo prep your samples, add 10 mL of bleaching solution to the worms and nutate for ~8 minutes until embryos are released from the mothers. The adult parts should be broken into about 2 pieces but not more than that.

*This is a critical step. Don’t bleach for too long or 2-cell stage embryos will be damaged. It is also temperature dependent, so if your samples are over or under bleached, it is likely due to a difference in temperature in your lab. Adjust time accordingly.*

1. Quickly centrifuge sample at 2000 x g for 1 min
1. Immediately remove supernatant and quench bleaching with 10 mL M9. 

*Worms should not be in bleach solution for more than 9 minutes.*

1. Centrifuge at 2000 x g for 1 min. 
1. Wash sample again with 10 mL M9. Wash the sample for a total of two times. 
1. If not embryo prepping your sample, just continue on to removing most of the supernatant (leaving ~1 mL) and transferring the sample to a microfuge tube. 

Sample Fixation \*this step can be optimized for your specific background strains used in imaging.

1. Centrifuge sample at 2000 x g for 1 min.
1. If sample is well pelleted at the bottom of the tube, remove supernatant. If sample is not well pelleted or pelleted along the length of the tube, turn the tube 180° and centrifuge again, repeating until embryos are pelleted at the bottom of the tube.
1. Fix the sample by adding 1 mL of -20°C methanol. Then vortex to break up the sample.
1. Immediately submerge the sample into liquid nitrogen for exactly 1 minute.
1. Remove sample from liquid nitrogen and place in -20°C freezer for ~4 min. Then centrifuge sample (2000 x g for 1 min) and remove methanol. 
   1. Don’t exceed 5 min in methanol. 
1. Resuspend sample in 1 mL of -20°C acetone and vortex. Then incubate for ~4 min in the -20°C freezer. Following incubation, centrifuge (2000 x g for 1 min) and aspirate off acetone. 
   1. Don’t exceed 5 min in acetone. 
1. Now prehybridize sample in 1 mL Wash Buffer A. Vortex sample to bring out of the pellet. 

Hybridize smFISH probes

1. Prepare 110 uL of hybridization solution for sample. 
1. Prepare a 1:20 dilution of the 25 uM smFISH probe in DEPC water. Final concentration of the probe will now be 1.25 uM. 

*We purchase smFISH probes at 5 nmol and then dilute them to 25 uM when they arrive.* 

1. Add 2 uL of diluted smFISH probe to hybridization solution. Vortex well, it is viscous.
   1. If probing for more than 1 transcript, just add the additional 2 uL of probe to the hybridization solution. 

*Treat annealed smiFISH probes as diluted smFISH probes. 2 uL of annealed smiFISH probes work well for most hybridizations.* 

*smiFISH probes can be used in combination with traditional smFISH probes.*

1. Centrifuge sample (2000 x g for 1 min) and aspirate off Wash A buffer.
1. Add 100 uL hybridization solution containing probes to the pelleted sample. 
1. Hybridize overnight at 37°C in the dark while shaking (450 rpm). 
   1. If need to leave samples for longer, up to 3 days of hybridization still works. 

Wash and Image

- Next day, add 1 mL of Wash Buffer A directly to the hybridized sample. 
- Incubate at 37°C for 30 min with shaking (450 rpm). 
- Centrifuge sample (2000 x g for 1 min) and aspirate supernatant.
- Add 1 mL of Wash Buffer A + 2 uL of 5 mg/mL DAPI solution to sample.
- Incubate at 37°C for 30 min with shaking (450 rpm).
- Centrifuge sample (2000 x g for 1 min) and aspirate supernatant.
- Add 1 mL of Wash Buffer B to sample and vortex. Incubate for 5 min at 37°C with shaking (450 rpm).
- Centrifuge sample (2000 x g for 1 min) and aspirate supernatant.
- Resuspend sample in 50 uL of mounting medium (or less depending on your sample density). Let the sample sit (protected from light) for between 10 – 30 min before moving on, to let the antifade permeate the cells. Can sit out at room temp. 
  - NEED to incubate for 30 min when using the 670 fluor.


Mount on slides

- Working at a dissecting scope, drop 2 – 6 uL of sample in mounting medium onto a single 8 mm 1.5 thickness round cover glass (Electron Microscopy Sciences, Cat#: 72296-08).
- Add the same volume of VectaShield Diamond anti-fade solution and pipette up and down to mix thoroughly. 
- After pipette mixing, draw off the same volume of VectaShield/sample that was just added. 
- Place a 1.5 thickness 22 mm x 22 mm square coverglass on top trying to avoid bubbles. 

*I do all of this atop a slide so that I can flip the coverglass sandwich over without getting it stuck to the microscope stage.*

- Remove as much liquid as possible from between the two cover glasses using a kimwipe placed up against the round one. The aim is to flatten the sample as much as possible without damaging the embryos/worms. 

*I will often press lightly with a pipette tip at the end to squeeze out that last little bit.*

- Affix the coverglass sandwich to a microscope slide using a Grace Bio-Lab Press-To-Seal silicon isolator (Sigma Aldrich; cat#: GBL664504-25ea) such that the sample will be imaged through the square coverglass.
- Head off to the microscope! 
- Store any un-imaged samples in the dark. Image same day.
