### NEEDED REAGENTS AND SOLUTIONS

**Wash Buffer A (10% v/v formamide)**
- Make fresh for each experiment. 
- Make up 3 mL for each sample to be hybridized. Combine reagents into a nuclease free tube and vortex to mix. 
  - 200 uL --> x3 --> 600 uL Wash Buffer A (Biosearch Technologies; Cat#: SMF-WA1-60) 
  - 0.7 mL --> x3 --> 2.1 mL DEPC water
  - 100 uL --> x3 --> 300 uL Deionized Formamide

*In fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), the addition of formamide to aqueous buffers solutions of DNA enables key procedural steps—such as the prehybridization denaturation, the reannealing step and the post-hybridization stringency washes—to be carried out at lower, less harsh temperatures without compromising the overall efficiency and specificity of the hybridization.

**Wash Buffer B**
- Make sure water has been added to Wash Buffer B before use (Biosearch Technologies; Cat#: SMF-WB1-20) 

**Hybridization Buffer (10% v/v formamide)**
- Prepare 110 uL for each sample to be hybridized
- Buffer should be mixed fresh for each experiment
- For a final volume of 110 uL, mix 99 µL of Stellaris RNA FISH Hybridization Buffer (Biosearch Technologies; Cat#: SMF-HB1-10) with 11 µL Deionized Formamide. 

*Do not freeze Hybridization Buffer.

**Methanol and Acetone** 
- Have room temperature regents available for fixing samples.

**Mounting Medium**
- Original Mounting Medium (5 mL)
  - 2.5 mL of 100% glycerol
  - 25 mg of N-propyl gallate\*
  - 100 uL of 1M Tris (pH 8.0)
  - 2.4 mL of DEPC H<sub>2</sub>0
- Updated Mounting Medium (3 mL)
  - 2.5 mL of 100% glycerol
  - 100 mg of N-propyl gallate\*
  - 400 uL of 1M Tris (pH 8.0)

*Add N-propyl gallate last
- Vortex until completely dissolved.
- Minimize exposure to light (N-propyl gallate is light sensitive).
- Prepare 1 mL aliquots in dark tubes or tubes wrapped in foil.
- Store at 4°C or -20°C.
- When medium turns yellow and begins crystalizing make fresh*

### PROTOCOL
- Grow worms until the desired developmental stage. 
- Harvest worms by washing them off plates with M9 and collecting them into a 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube.
- Pellet sample (2000g, 30 sec), then rotate 180 degrees and re-pellet. Aspirate supernatant and discard. 
- Resuspend in 1 mL of M9 to wash. Then pellet and aspirate supernatant. 
  - Repeat wash until supernatant is clear.
- Fix the sample by adding 1 mL of methanol, then vortexing. Incubate for 5 min at RT while nutating. Then pellet the sample and remove the fixative. Immediately add 1 mL of acetone and then vortex. Incubate for 5 min at RT while nutating. Finally, pellet the sample and remove the fixative.
- Wash sample by adding 1 mL Wash Buffer A. Lightly vortex, then pellet and remove supernatant.
  - Repeat wash for a second time. Then pellet and remove supernatant. 

**Hybridize smFISH probes**
- Prepare 110 uL of hybridization solution for sample. 
- Prepare a 1:20 dilution of the 25 uM smFISH probe in DEPC water. Final concentration of the probe will now be 1.25 uM. 

*We purchase smFISH probes at 5 nmol and then dilute them to 25 uM when they arrive.

- Add 2 uL of diluted smFISH probe to hybridization solution. Vortex well, it is viscous.
  - If probing for more than 1 transcript, just add the additional 2 uL of probe to the hybridization solution. 

*Treat annealed smiFISH probes as diluted smFISH probes. 2 uL of annealed smiFISH probes work well for most hybridizations.

*smiFISH probes can be used in combination with traditional smFISH probes.

- Add 100 uL hybridization solution containing probes to the pelleted sample. 
- Hybridize overnight at 37°C in the dark while shaking (1000 rpm). 

**Wash and Image**

- Next day, add 1 mL of Wash Buffer A directly to the hybridized sample. 
- Incubate at 37°C for 30 min with shaking (1000 rpm). 
- Pellet sample (2000g, 30 sec), then rotate 180 degrees and re-pellet. Aspirate supernatant and discard.

OPTIONAL: Add 1 mL of Wash Buffer A plus DAPI (5 mg/mL) to the sample. Incubate at 37°C for 30 min with shaking (1000 rpm). Centrifuge sample (2000g, 30 sec), then rotate 180 degrees and re-pellet. Aspirate supernatant and discard.

- Add 1 mL of Wash Buffer B to sample and vortex. Incubate for 5 min at 37°C with shaking (1000 rpm).
- Pellet sample (2000g, 30 sec), then rotate 180 degrees and re-pellet. Aspirate supernatant and discard.
- Resuspend sample in 50 uL of mounting medium (or less depending on your sample density). Let the sample sit (protected from light) for between 10 – 30 min before moving on, to let the antifade permeate the cells. Can sit out at room temp. 
  - NEED to incubate for 30 min when using the 670 fluor.

**Mount on slides**
- Version A
  - Working at a dissecting scope, drop 2 – 6 uL of sample in mounting medium onto a single 8 mm 1.5 thickness round cover glass (Electron Microscopy Sciences, Cat#: 72296-08).
  - Add the same volume of VectaShield Diamond anti-fade solution and pipette up and down to mix thoroughly. 
  - After pipette mixing, draw off the same volume of VectaShield/sample that was just added. 
  - Place a 1.5 thickness 22 mm x 22 mm square coverglass on top trying to avoid bubbles.
    - I do all of this atop a slide so that I can flip the coverglass sandwich over without getting it stuck to the microscope stage.
  - Remove as much liquid as possible from between the two cover glasses using a kimwipe placed up against the round one. The aim is to flatten the sample as much as possible without damaging the embryos/worms.
    - I will often press lightly with a pipette tip at the end to squeeze out that last little bit.
  - Affix the coverglass sandwich to a microscope slide using a Grace Bio-Lab Press-To-Seal silicon isolator (Sigma Aldrich; cat#: GBL664504-25ea) such that the sample will be imaged through the square coverglass.
  - Head off to the microscope! 
  - Store any un-imaged samples in the dark. Image same day.
- Version B
  - Add 5 uL of VectaShield Diamond anti-fade solution to the center of a microscope slide. 
  - Then add 5 uL of sample to the VectaShield.
  - Add a square coverslip to the sample.
  - Once the coverslip is down and the sample has moved across the coverslip (fully covering), apply Valap sealant or Insta-Dry clear Nail polish.
