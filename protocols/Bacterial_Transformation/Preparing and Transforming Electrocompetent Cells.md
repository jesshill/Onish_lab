### Prior to starting:
1. Get an ice bucket.
1. Thaw needed plasmid DNA on ice.
1. Grab appropriate selection plate(s). 
   1. Selection plate(s) needs to be at RT prior to spreading sample on.
   1. Can warm up in the incubator or leave at RT. 
1. Label microcentrifuge tubes for samples (you will need 2 tubes per sample).

### Preparation of electrocompetent cells:
1. Grow 10 mL overnight culture in 0.1% Tween 20 and 8 ug/mL PMBN (polymyxin B nonapeptide) to help permeablize the bacterial cell walls and prevent biofilm formation.
2. Take the OD600 reading of each sample and record it in the table below. In order to prevent arcing, calculate the total resuspension volume (TRV) of 300mM sucrose you will need to add to your sample in step 7 with this formula: (resuspension volume) = 875(OD600 reading) + 15. Units are in uL. 
1. Pellet sample (3000 g, 10 min, RT) and aspirate supernatent down to 1 mL. 
1. Pipette mix and distribute 1 mL of culture into a sterile microcentrifuge tube. 
1. Centrifuge at 16,000g @ RT for 2 mins. 
1. Remove supernatant and resuspend in 1 mL of 300 mM sucrose. Pipette mix to resuspend sample. 
   1. Repeat sucrose wash 1 time, for a total of 2 washes. 
1. After second wash, remove supernatant and resuspend cells according to the resuspension volumes you calculated earlier in step 2. Depending on your starting OD600, you may not want to use your entire sample in order to avoid overfilling the microcentrifuge tube (adjust as you see fit). Keep in mind that each electroporation shock will use 50 ul of your sample.

### Transformation of Cells through Electroporation:
1. To 1 mm (0.1 cm) gap-width cuvettes add:
   1. 50 uL cells in 300 mM sucrose.
   1. 2.5 uL p64967 plasmid @ 10 ng/uL
   1. 2.5 uL p65032 (GmR) plasmid @ 10 ng/uL
   1. Do not add volume of DNA over 10% volume of cells. This will cause arcing.
1. Electroporate with these settings:
   1. 25 uF, 200 ohms, 1.25 kV (can range from 1.25 – 2.4 kV)
   1. Recommended field strength for bacteria is 3-24 kV/cm. We use a 0.1 cm gap cuvette, so to achieve a 24 kV/cm field strength à 24 kV/cm x 0.1 cm = 2.4 kV
1. After shock, add 1 mL of RT LB media, genlty pipette mix, and transfer to a new and labeled microcentrifuge tube.
   1. Let recover at appropriate temperature for 1 hour – overnight (dependent on bacterial doubling time).
1. After recovery, centrifuge sample for 2 mins @16,000 g, discard supernatant down to ~50 uL and resuspend.
1. Plate sample on selection plate (i.e., LB Gen) using plate spread method.
