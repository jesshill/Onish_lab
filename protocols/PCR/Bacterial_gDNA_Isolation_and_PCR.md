### Isolate bacterial gDNA (Quick-DNA Miniprep Plus kit, Zymo research) 

Follow kit instructions for cultured cells (which includes bacteria) with implemented differences (i.e., lysis time and additional centerfugation time prior to elution)

### Set up PCR

For Q5 DNA polymerase, set up the PCR as follows (prepare on ice!): 

|Component |1x volume | #x volume | [Final] | Check when added |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| H20* | 33 uL | ... | ... |  |
| 5X Q5 reaction buffer | 10 uL | ... | 1X |  |
| 10 mM dNTPs | 1 uL | ... | ... |  |
| Forward primer (100 uM) | 0.25 uL | ... | ... |  |
| Reverse primer (100 uM) | 0.25 uL | ... | ... |  |
| Q5 Taq polymerase* | 0.5 uL | ... | ... |  |
| Total | 45 uL | # uL |  |  |

*Amount of H20 can change to accomidate more dilute gDNA concentrations

*Add enzyme last!

To a PCR tube, add 45 uL of PCR mix and 5 uL of gDNA (10 ng/uL) for a total reaction volume of 50 uL.

Once all components are added, briefly spin down the sample to collect contents at the bottom of the tube. 

### Run PCR

Add sample tubes to the thermocycler.

Run the PCR with the following thermocycle settings:
- 98C 30sec
  - 98C 10sec
  - 65C 30sec
  - 72C 10min
  - repeat for a total of 30X cycles! 
- 72C 2min 
- 12C hold 

### Run PCR product on gel to confirm 

make gel:
- combine 1 g of agarose with 100 mL of TBE buffer in a flask. Then melt in the microwave. This makes a 1% w/v agar gel.
- Add gel stain prior to casting. We are using syber safe green which comes as 10,000X so need to add 10 uL to the 100 mL. Gently swirl then cast the gel.

Prepare sample for gel: 
- Take 20 uL of DEPC water or molecular grade water and add to a fresh PCR tube. Then add 5 uL of sample (PCR product), and 5 uL of 6x purple gel loading dye. This brings the final volume to 30 uL.  
- Now load sample (can do all 30 uL) into well in gel. 
- Run gel at 150 v for about 1 hr but keep track.
