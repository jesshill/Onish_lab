### PROTOCOL
1. Chunk 1 or 2 large plates of N2 worms or other desired worm strain
2. Embryo prep worms for synchronization. Cound embryos using hemocytometer to determine their concentration. Seed 1000 embryos onto experimental plate(s) of interest based on sample concentration.
3. Grow worms to desired stage.
4. Harvest worms off plate with sterile M9 and transfer to a sterile Eppendorf tube.
5. Pellet (1 min, 2000 g, RT) and remove the supernatant. 
6. Wash worms 4 times with 1 mL of sterile M9. Pellet (1 min, 2000 g, RT) and remove the supernatant in between washes. 
7. After the 4<sup>th</sup> wash, add 1 mL of M9 and let worms nutate at RT for 5 min (to enhance digestion or defecation of any transient gut bacteria). Then pellet (1 min, 2000 g, RT) and remove the supernatant.
8. Bring worms up to 0.2 mL in sterile M9. Then place worms on ice for 10 min to paralyze them. 
9. Surface sterilize worms by adding 3 volumes of 1% bleaching solution and incubate at RT while nutating for 1 min. 
10. Post incubation, immediately pellet (1 min, 2000 g, RT) the sample and remove the supernatant. **(Don’t bleach for longer than 2 min)**
11. Wash worms 2 times with 1 mL of sterile M9. Pellet (1 min, 2000 g, RT) and remove the supernatant in between washes. **However, after the last wash, aspirate** **and save the supernatant for plating to determine the background level of bacteria.** 
12. Resuspend sample in 200 uL of sterile M9 for mortar/pestle lysing. 
13. Lyse worms with a sterilized pestle in the eppi tube. Perform stroke/twists for about 2-3 min. Check the sample under the dissecting scope after 2 min and see if worms are broken up enough.  
14. Plate 100 uL of worm lysate and supernatant onto appropriate plates and spread. Culture plates at the appropriate temperature (i.e. 20C or 37C) and count CFUs the next day (may need to incubate for another day). Also image the plates in the gel imager for CFU counting. 
15. Count plates with between 30 – 300 colonies. Otherwise, plates are Too Few To Count (TFTC) or Too Many To Count (TMTC).
